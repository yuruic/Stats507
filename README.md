# Stats507

This is a repository for the work I have done in the course Stats507.

## [PS2_Question3](https://github.com/yuruic/Stats507/blob/ps4/PS2_Question3.ipynb)
We use Python and Pandas to read and append the demographic datasets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES the years 2011-2018.
Variables are the unique ids (SEQN), age (RIDAGEYR), race and ethnicity (RIDRETH3), education (DMDEDUC2), and marital status (DMDMARTL), along with the 
following variables related to the survey weighting: (RIDSTATR, SDMVPSU, SDMVSTRA, WTMEC2YR, WTINT2YR). The data prepared in this question works as the 
starting point for analyses in one or more future problem sets.
